Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a variety of small Python projects and exercises created while learning and improving core programming skills. Each project focuses on foundational concepts such as data structures, loops, conditionals, file handling, functions, and basic problem-solving.

- The purpose of this repository is to:

- Practice and strengthen Python fundamentals

- Build a portfolio of practical learning progress

- Experiment with automation and small real-world utilities

- Document growth as a future Python developer
  

# Repository Structure

Projects are organized into individual folders.
Each folder may include:

- Python source code (.py)

- A short project README (description & objective - optional)

- Output files or examples where relevant

Example structure:

├─ project-3/
└─ ...

# Skills Practiced

- Python syntax & fundamentals

- Variables, input & output

- Lists, dictionaries & loops

- Basic error handling

- Functions & cleaner code structure

- Version control with GitHub


# Roadmap (Planned Improvements)

- Add more beginner and intermediate projects

- Improve documentation for each project

- Add automation and data projects (web scraping, CSV handling, etc.)

- Transition into more advanced topics:
object-oriented programming, APIs, databases, and AI fundamentals

Progress is continuous — new updates will be published regularly.
